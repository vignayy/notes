### Java 8 Key Features List

1. **Lambda Expressions**
    - Anonymous functions providing a cleaner and more concise syntax for functional programming.

2. **Functional Interfaces**
    - Interfaces with a single abstract method (e.g., `Predicate`, `Function`), used with Lambda expressions.

3. **Streams API**
    - Enables functional-style operations on sequences of elements (collections), supporting filtering, mapping, and
      reducing.

4. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**
    - Allows interfaces to have concrete methods using `default` and `static` keywords.

5. **Method References**
    - Shorthand for calling methods using `ClassName::methodName`, enhancing readability and reducing boilerplate.

6. **Optional Class**
    - A container object to avoid `NullPointerException` by representing optional values.

7. **New Date and Time API (java.time)**
    - Modern, thread-safe classes (`LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, etc.) for handling dates and times.

8. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**
    - Allows execution of JavaScript code within Java applications.

9. **Collectors in Stream API**
    - Collects stream elements into lists, maps, or other collections with predefined collectors like `toList()`
      and `groupingBy()`.

10. **Parallel Streams**
    - Facilitates parallel processing of streams for improved performance.
