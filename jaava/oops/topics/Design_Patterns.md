Design patterns in object-oriented design (OOD) are proven solutions to common problems that occur in software design.
They are like blueprints for solving specific issues, and they help make code more reusable, flexible, and maintainable.
Design patterns are not finished designs but rather templates that can be customized to fit particular needs.

Here’s a detailed overview of some key design patterns, categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and
Behavioral.

### 1. Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the
situation. They abstract the instantiation process and make it more flexible.

**a. Singleton Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Example**: Database connection managers or configuration managers that should only have one instance throughout the
  application.
- **How it works**: A class has a private constructor and a static method that returns the unique instance of the class.

**b. Factory Method Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define an interface for creating an object but allow subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be
  created.
- **Example**: A logistics management system where different types of transportation (e.g., Truck, Ship) are created
  based on the logistics requirement.
- **How it works**: A creator class declares a factory method which returns an object of a type that is
  subclass-specific.

**c. Abstract Factory Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their
  concrete classes.
- **Example**: A UI toolkit that can create different themed components (e.g., Windows and macOS) without needing to
  know which exact components will be created.
- **How it works**: An abstract factory interface provides methods for creating abstract products, while concrete
  factories implement these methods to create specific products.

**d. Builder Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction
  process can create different representations.
- **Example**: Building a complex document with various sections (headers, paragraphs, images) where the exact details
  of the document are determined at runtime.
- **How it works**: A builder class constructs the product step by step and allows for customization through methods.

**e. Prototype Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.
- **Example**: Cloning complex objects like configuration settings or objects with multiple variations.
- **How it works**: The prototype object provides a method to clone itself, allowing new instances to be created based
  on this existing prototype.

### 2. Structural Patterns

Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes or objects and help ensure that if one part of a system changes,
the entire system does not need to change.

**a. Adapter Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Allow incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
- **Example**: Integrating an old system with a new system where the new system requires a different interface.
- **How it works**: An adapter class implements the target interface and translates requests into a format understood by
  the adaptee.

**b. Bridge Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Example**: A graphics application that needs to support multiple rendering engines. The application can remain
  unchanged while the rendering engines can be swapped.
- **How it works**: The bridge pattern separates the abstraction (e.g., shape) from the implementation (e.g., drawing
  API) using a bridge interface.

**c. Composite Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Allow individual objects and compositions of objects to be treated uniformly.
- **Example**: A file system where both files and directories can be treated uniformly, even though directories contain
  multiple files or other directories.
- **How it works**: Composite objects are created with a common interface that allows clients to treat individual
  objects and compositions uniformly.

**d. Decorator Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Add new functionalities to objects dynamically without altering their structure.
- **Example**: Adding scroll bars, borders, or other features to graphical components at runtime.
- **How it works**: A decorator class wraps the original class and adds additional functionality. The decorator
  implements the same interface as the original class.

**e. Facade Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making the subsystem easier to use.
- **Example**: A library management system where a facade provides simplified access to various components like book
  cataloging, borrowing, and returning.
- **How it works**: A facade class provides simplified methods to interact with a complex subsystem.

**f. Flyweight Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Reduce the cost of creating and managing a large number of objects by sharing as many data as possible
  with similar objects.
- **Example**: A text editor where many characters are displayed, but each character only needs to be created once.
- **How it works**: The flyweight pattern creates a factory that manages a pool of flyweight objects, sharing data among
  similar objects.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with object collaboration and the delegation of responsibilities between objects.

**a. Chain of Responsibility Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Pass a request along a chain of handlers until it is handled or the end of the chain is reached.
- **Example**: An event handling system where events are passed through various handlers for processing.
- **How it works**: Each handler in the chain either handles the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.

**b. Command Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.
- **Example**: A menu system where each menu item is a command object that can be executed, undone, or queued.
- **How it works**: Commands are encapsulated in command objects that execute a specific action.

**c. Interpreter Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter to interpret sentences in the
  language.
- **Example**: A simple scripting language where expressions are parsed and evaluated.
- **How it works**: An interpreter class processes language expressions and provides results.

**d. Iterator Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying
  representation.
- **Example**: Iterating over a collection of items, such as a list or a tree, in a way that does not expose the
  collection’s internal structure.
- **How it works**: An iterator class provides methods to traverse and access elements in the aggregate.

**e. Mediator Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling.
- **Example**: A chat room where users communicate with each other through a central mediator object.
- **How it works**: The mediator object handles communication between different components, preventing them from
  referring to each other directly.

**f. Memento Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Example**: An undo feature in a text editor where you can revert to previous states of the document.
- **How it works**: The memento object stores the state of an originator object, allowing the originator to restore its
  state later.

**g. Observer Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents
  are notified and updated automatically.
- **Example**: A news agency where subscribers (observers) are notified whenever new news (subject) is published.
- **How it works**: The subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes.

**h. State Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing as if it changed its
  class.
- **Example**: A media player that behaves differently depending on whether it is playing, paused, or stopped.
- **How it works**: The state pattern encapsulates state-specific behaviors in separate state classes.

**i. Strategy Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- **Example**: A sorting algorithm selection in a program where different strategies (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort) can
  be used interchangeably.
- **How it works**: The strategy pattern defines a strategy interface and concrete implementations for each algorithm.
  The context uses the strategy interface to execute the algorithm.

**j. Template Method Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but allow subclasses to redefine certain steps
  without changing the algorithm’s structure.
- **Example**: A cooking recipe where the steps are fixed, but the ingredients can vary.
- **How it works**: The template method defines the algorithm, and subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm.

**k. Visitor Pattern**

- **Purpose**: Define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
- **Example**: An operation to calculate the total cost of items in a shopping cart where the cart elements (items) are
  different types.
- **How it works**: The visitor pattern defines a visitor class that implements operations on various element classes
  without changing their code.

Each design pattern addresses specific design challenges and can be used alone or in combination with other patterns to
solve complex design problems. Understanding and applying these patterns appropriately can greatly enhance the quality
and flexibility of software systems.
